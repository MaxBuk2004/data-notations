<p>A <strong>laptop</strong> (also known as a notebook computer) is a small, portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor. Typically, it has an LCD or LED screen attached to its upper lid, and an alphanumeric keyboard on its lower lid. Laptops are designed to be versatile enough for both mobile and stationary use, operating on both battery and power supply. The compact size and portability of laptops make them popular among individuals who need computing capabilities on the go.

<p>Historically, laptops have evolved significantly, adapting to the growing demands of users and advancements in technology. Originally targeted toward business users needing computing power away from the office, modern laptops are now suitable for a variety of uses including gaming, professional creative work, and general consumer applications. With improvements in processing power and battery efficiency, laptops have largely bridged the performance gap with desktop computers.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-laptops">Types of Laptops</h2>
<p>Laptops come in a variety of types, each designed for specific use cases. <strong>Ultrabooks</strong>, for example, prioritize portability and often boast high-resolution displays and premium build materials. These laptops are generally thinner and lighter than standard models and are ideal for frequent travelers or those who value a sleek design.</p>
<p><strong>Gaming laptops</strong> are a specialized category that focus on delivering high-performance graphics and processing capabilities. Equipped with powerful GPUs and CPUs, they handle resource-intensive games and applications smoothly. Gaming laptops often have advanced cooling systems to manage the additional heat generated by their powerful components.</p>
<p>Another category is the <strong>2-in-1 laptops</strong>, which combine the functionality of a laptop and a tablet. With touch-sensitive screens that can fold or detach, 2-in-1 laptops provide versatile use modes, catering to users who need both a traditional laptop setup and a tablet form factor in a single device.</p>
<h2 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop Hardware</h2>
<p>Laptops are composed of numerous hardware components that work together to deliver their functionality. These components are integrated into a compact structure, optimizing for both performance and portability. Unlike desktops, many of these components are not upgradeable due to the limited space and customized nature of laptop designs.</p>
<p>Here are some of the main hardware components of laptops:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> - Acts as the brain of the laptop, handling calculations and operations. More details on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU on Wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Memory (RAM)</strong> - Stores data temporarily for quick access, impacting multitasking and application performance.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Drive</strong> (SSD or HDD) - Stores the operating system, software, and files.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</strong> - Renders images, videos, and animations; essential for gaming and creative work. Learn more about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU on Wikipedia</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong> - Powers the laptop when it is not plugged into an external power source.</li>
